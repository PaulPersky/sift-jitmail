Email smarter. With the Timely Mail Sift you can schedule emails to be sent at a specific time and clear your inbox by scheduling emails to be brought back to your inbox when you want to deal with them.

## Social coding
We like pull requests. If you want to fork it, add your own functionality, run it on your own data  and share it with the world, that's also cool.
